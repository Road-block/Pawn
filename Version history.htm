<h1>Pawn past and future versions</h1>

<p>
	I got tired of the version history section of the <a href="Readme.htm">
	readme</a> being longer than the rest of it, so I moved parts here.</p>
<h2>Future versions</h2>
<p>There are many features that I&#39;d like to add in future versions of Pawn, 
besides fixing issues listed in the &quot;known issues&quot; below.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Now that the Cataclysm beta is in progress, I need to add a way to 
	select the quality level of meta gems to use between 80 and 85, just like 
	you can for non-meta gems.</li>
	<li>I need to add a way for scales to choose a specific meta gem, and the 
	Wowhead scales should always have the best meta gem for each class/spec 
	chosen, since that&#39;s not always the one with the best primary stats.</li>
	<li>To make Pawn more approachable for new users, I think that by default 
	I&#39;ll remove Pawn values from trinkets (since trinkets have secondary effects 
	and thus their Pawn values are very rarely accurate).&nbsp; (I&#39;ll add an option to turn values back 
	on for trinkets, and there&#39;s already an option to toggle current item 
	values.)</li>
	<li>I&#39;m investigating how Pawn could eliminate or reduce its dependence on 
	lots and lots of hand-translated text patterns by using new API features 
	added in patch 3.2.<ul>
		<li>Specifically, the new API function GetItemStats was added.&nbsp; 
		Unfortunately, at this time, it only supports returning stats for the 
		base version of an item, not the current version, which makes it 
		insufficient for Pawn.</li>
		<li>I could use GetItemStats for base stats only and use the old code 
		for enchanted stats, but that&#39;s starting to get pretty complicated, and 
		it would likely introduce weird bugs where DPS would be slightly 
		different between a base item and an enchanted item due to differences 
		in calculation methods, or old-world DPS enchantments would not work 
		properly, or things like those.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Compare tab should be updated to allow comparisons between two 
	one-handed items and a two-handed item.</li>
	<li>It might be nice to have a zoom feature for the UI since it&#39;s kinda big, 
	especially for non-widescreen monitors.</li>
	<li>Additional ways you might be able to get to the Compare tab in the 
	future:<ul>
		<li>I could add little Pawn buttons to item link windows.&nbsp; I 
		initially decided not to do this because I thought they&#39;d be obnoxious.</li>
		<li>I could add a &quot;compare this item with what I already have&quot; button to 
		loot roll windows to make it more obvious than just right-clicking the 
		icon.&nbsp; Or, I could even just add a little comparison window that 
		sticks to the side.</li>
		<li>In addition to the &quot;currently equipped&quot; buttons in the lower-left, I 
		could also remember the best 1-2 items you&#39;ve ever equipped for a given 
		slot type, and display those there too.&nbsp; This helps those with 
		multiple gear sets (for example, shamans with a resto set and an enhance 
		set).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Right now, the Compare tab only shows stats that have nonzero values in 
	your currently-selected scale.&nbsp; I could add an option to show all stats, though that 
	would make it a lot harder to use at a glance—weapons have a lot of stats, 
	including 8-12 stats just for tracking damage and speed, plus any real stats 
	on the item.</li>
	<li>I might change the Compare tab so that it still shows item stats even if 
	there&#39;s only one item.</li>
	<li>I could improve the Compare tab to support comparing multiple sets of 
	items at once.&nbsp; (For example, an entire gear set versus another 
	person&#39;s entire gear set.)</li>
	<li>I still haven&#39;t optimized some parts of Pawn for performance.&nbsp; One 
	thing that I could do is collect statistics on how often various item stats 
	are used, and then reorder them in the files so that the most common stats 
	are checked first, and the rarest stats are checked last.&nbsp; That might 
	be difficult and make translation much more challenging, though.</li>
	<li>I could add an option to hide values from items you could never equip.&nbsp; 
	For example, shamans could have values hidden on swords, sigils, plate 
	armor, and wands.</li>
	<li>There are other things I could annotate tooltips with, but I&#39;m not sure 
	which things I&#39;ll do, since some might conflict with other mods or require a 
	lot of configuration.</li>
	<li>I could make it so that Pawn could generate Wowhead/LootRank URLs from your 
	scales.</li>
	<li>Pawn could keep track of the best item of each type (Helm, Bracers, 
	Trinket, ...) that you&#39;ve ever equipped, and then show you how the item 
	you&#39;re hovering over compares to that.&nbsp; There would be one &quot;best item&quot; 
	per scale, per item type (two for rings and trinkets).&nbsp; Or, it could just show a difference between 
	the hovered item and the equipped item.&nbsp; This would be useful for 
	evaluating gear sets that you&#39;re not currently wearing—for example, if a DPS 
	cloak drops but you&#39;re in your tanking gear.</li>
	<li>One very cool feature would be a way to automatically share Pawn scale 
	tags with another player through an in-game whisper.&nbsp; Something like 
	/pawn share Vger &lt;scale name&gt;.&nbsp; Or, there could just be a window 
	where you could type another player&#39;s name to see their Pawn scales if they 
	use Pawn... sort of like a Scalesteal spell.</li>
	<li>I&#39;d love to integrate with AtlasLoot&#39;s Wish List feature, helping you 
	find and manage upgrades to your items.</li>
	<li>Down the road, I might also like to add a way for people to assign values to 
	specific item effects and enchantments.&nbsp; For example, Spellsurge is a 
	useful weapon enchantment for casters, but Pawn doesn&#39;t give it a value.&nbsp; 
	Right now, you have to rely on the asterisks and intuition to properly 
	evaluate Spellsurge versus another weapon enchantment.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t 
	decided how this would work just yet...&nbsp; Is it part of a single scale, 
	or a per-character option?&nbsp; Does it assign stats (Intellect +30) or 
	points (Score +30)?&nbsp; And what&#39;s the point of assigning it a value when 
	you&#39;d generally use unenchanted value in these situations anyway?</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Known issues and bugs</h2>
<p>Check here first if you think you&#39;ve found a new bug; maybe I already know 
about it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Unverified: Pawn adds the (?) icon to the line that EPGP adds to 
	tooltips as if it were a stat.</li>
	<li>Unverified: wands may only be getting the regular damage stats, and not 
	the ranged damage stats.</li>
	<li>Unverified: Fiery and other weapon damage enchantments are 
	only counting for the basic DPS stat, and not for the specialized DPS stats 
	like melee DPS.</li>
	<li>Weapon damage is actually stored in the game with more precision than is 
	displayed.&nbsp; For example, Gavel of Naaru Blessings says in-game that it 
	does 16-117 damage, but according to the game files, it does 16.12-116.12 
	damage.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to report its DPS as being slightly different 
	than the in-game tooltip says.</li>
	<li>Item links that you click that aren&#39;t already in your game cache show 
	the message &quot;Retrieving item information&quot; and then when the item appears, there 
	are no Pawn values until the next time you show that item.&nbsp; This type of 
	problem has existed forever, and also affects the Blizzard feedback UI 
	line, but still I&#39;d like to find a way to solve it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ancient release history</h2>
<p>For recent version history, see the <a href="Readme.htm">Pawn readme</a>.</p>
<h3>Version 1.2.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>What used to be called the enchanted value of an item is now the current 
	value, and what used to be called the unenchanted value is now the base 
	value.&nbsp; The word &quot;base&quot; now also appears on tooltips.&nbsp; (No functionality has changed; this is just a terminology 
	change.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the error that occurred when hovering over Brewfest steins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an error that occurred when hovering over profession recipes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now select what quality of gems to use for each of your scales 
	on the Gems tab: uncommon, rare, or epic.&nbsp; Each scale can have a 
	different quality level, so your main spec scale can use epic gems, and your 
	offspec scale can use rare gems.</li>
	<li>By popular request, enchanted values of items now no longer include any 
	points for sockets on the item, since the enchanted value is meant to 
	reflect the current state of the item.&nbsp; This means that before you put 
	gems in an item, the enchanted value of an item will be lower than the 
	unenchanted value.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where occasionally items that weren&#39;t enchanted would show 
	two equal values, such as &quot;123.4 (123.4)&quot;.&nbsp; (This was only a display 
	issue; the values were being calculated properly.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn will now calculate correct socket values if you have the &quot;normalize 
	values (like Wowhead)&quot; option enabled.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the &quot;attempt to perform arithmetic on field &#39;?&#39; (a nil value)&quot; 
	error that some users were experiencing in Pawn 1.2.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li><b>Note:</b> Upon installation, this version of Pawn will automatically make adjustments to 
	each of your
scales&#39; socket values.&nbsp; To avoid this, you can turn off the option for each 
	scale to always correctly match gem colors.</li>
	<li>By default, Pawn will automatically choose the best rare-quality level 
	80 gem of each color and use the value of that gem when calculating item 
	values.&nbsp; Most people will no longer ever need to manually set values 
	for red, yellow, or blue sockets.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a new Gems tab in the Pawn UI.&nbsp; This tab shows you the 
	best rare-quality level 80 gems that are available for any of your scales.&nbsp; 
	Never again will you wonder which gems to have cut for that new boss drop.
	<ul>
		<li>The Gems tab also displays suggested meta gems, but take these with a grain of
		salt; Pawn ignores the special effects on the gem.</li>
		<li>The Gems tab only considers rare-quality level 80 gems.&nbsp; I&#39;ll 
		add support for epic gems very soon in an upcoming Pawn update.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn will now add a tooltip to the item socketing window displaying the 
	suggested gems to use when socketing that item for each of your scales.&nbsp; 
	In addition, the window now has a Pawn button that takes you directly to the 
	Gems tab for more details.</li>
	<li>Meta sockets are now covered by two values instead of one: the old "Meta socket" value
	is now "Meta: stats" and covers the normal stat bonuses from meta gems.  The
	new value is "Meta: effect" and covers the bonus effects from meta gems.  Helms with an
	empty meta socket will get the values from both added to their totals.  Helms with a
	filled meta socket will get the values of Meta: effect and the actual stats on the gem added
	to their totals.  This reflects the fact that stat-for-stat, helms with meta sockets are clearly
	better than helms without them because of the added effects that meta gems bring.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of MP5 in the default scale to correspond with current itemization.</li>
	<li>Removed the Pawn feature to show item levels, as it is now built into the game.</li>
	<li>Fixed the &quot;Could not parse the item link&quot; error that appeared when 
	clicking the links that items such as the Titanium Seal of Dalaran and Worn 
	Troll Dice add to chat.</li>
	<li>Corrected the display of socket bonuses on weapons in the Compare tab.</li>
	<li>(English) Enchant Boots: Greater Vitality now works again.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.13</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed the "attempt to perform arithmetic on local 'Dps&#39; (a nil value)&quot; 
	issue introduced by 1.1.12 relating to feral attack power calculations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.12</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Though it doesn&#39;t actually exist as a real weapon stat anymore, druids 
	can once again assign a value to feral attack power instead of weapon DPS if 
	they don&#39;t like multiplying by 14.</li>
	<li>Updated Outfitter support to handle newer versions of Outfitter.&nbsp; 
	(If alternate outfit tooltips stop working for you, be sure to download the 
	latest version of Outfitter too.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.11</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When &quot;show item levels&quot; is enabled, you can now hover over the Pawn 
	button on your character sheet or an inspected player&#39;s character sheet to 
	get an estimate of that player&#39;s average item level in epic gear.&nbsp; For 
	example, an epic gear level of 200 means that the player is in full 10-man 
	Naxxramas gear; 213 means that the player is in full 25-man Naxxramas gear.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.10</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for Pawn values on Outfitter alternate-outfit tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where scales that used to have a value for colorless sockets 
	back when Pawn included them as a possible stat would show inaccurate values 
	if you had normalization turned on.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where armor penetration gems (like Fractured Scarlet Ruby) 
	didn&#39;t work in the English version.</li>
	<li>Added support for Titanium Plating and Enchant Weapon: Accuracy.</li>
	<li>Minor updates for colorblind mode in patch 3.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Removed the feral attack power stat entirely since it no longer exists 
	directly on weapons.&nbsp; (Feral druids should increase their value for 
	weapon DPS accordingly.)</li>
	<li>Added compatibility with the mod tdItemTip.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>One more potential fix for the error that I worked on in the last 
	version.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed an issue where Pawn would in rare situations cause an error when it was 
	loaded for the first time for a character (either a new character, or a 
	character new to Pawn).&nbsp; Whether or not a given person would actually 
	experience this bug is essentially random.&nbsp; This is also reported to 
	have worked around game crashes that a few people were seeing.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Greater Vitality, and the hit rating 
	effect of Titanium Weapon Chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Feral druids and death knights rejoice!&nbsp; You can now assign 
	separate values to base armor (on cloth, cloaks, leather, mail, and plate) and bonus 
	armor (on weapons, trinkets, necklaces, rings, and enchantments).<ul>
		<li>Please note that pre-Wrath items that had bonus armor (in green 
		text) will have the full armor value reported as base armor even though 
		some is bonus armor.&nbsp; There is currently no way for mods to tell 
		the difference.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Updated the default values for the socket stats to more appropriate 
	values, assuming that you would use level 80 blue gems in them.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be changed.</li>
	<li>Support for colorless / prismatic sockets added by blacksmithing has 
	been removed.&nbsp; Since these sockets never appear on items normally, and 
	they are simply an interim stage (you&#39;d never socket an item and then decide 
	not to put a gem in it), I decided it didn&#39;t make sense to assign values to 
	them. </li>
	<li>The red text that appears after socketed jewelcrafter-only BoP gems that 
	says that they require jewelcrafting will no longer appear with an asterisk 
	(*).</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Icewalker.</li>
	<li>Worked around a bug that could cause the Compare tab to stop working in 
	certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug where, on the Compare tab, meta sockets would appear under 
	the &quot;socket bonus&quot; heading instead of the &quot;sockets&quot; heading.</li>
	<li>Enchantments that are on enchanters&#39; rings when you are not an enchanter 
	(the ones that appear in red) will no longer appear with asterisks (*).</li>
	<li>Armor penetration rating on new Wrath of the Lich King items will now be 
	interpreted correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This is the patch 3.0 version of Pawn, and will not work properly on WoW 
	2.4.x.&nbsp; The stats Spell damage, Healing, Spell hit rating, Spell crit 
	rating, and Spell haste rating have all been removed.&nbsp; Spell damage and 
	Healing have been replaced with Spell power, and the three Spell combat 
	ratings have been combined into hybrid ratings that work for both casters 
	and non-casters.&nbsp; Pawn will update your scales automatically, but you 
	might want to check the values of those stats to make sure that they are in 
	line with what you&#39;d expect.</li>
	<li>Added stats that allow you to assign different values to different armor 
	types (such as plate, cloth, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for account-bound (gold-quality) items and more new things that appear in 
	WoW 3.0.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error message that could appear when using some item links from 
	sites like Wowhead.</li>
	<li>Armor penetration works once more on WoW 3.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Link Wrangler compatibility, which was broken in Pawn 1.1.</li>
	<li>Items that have at least one recognized stat (normally marked with an 
	asterisk) will be marked as such in the Compare tab.&nbsp; (This feature 
	existed in 1.1 betas but did not appear in the final version.)</li>
	<li>Added support for Lake Wintergrasp items and the Scourgestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn has been tested on both the live realms and on the Wrath of 
the Lich King beta, and includes <i>tons</i> of fixes to make Pawn work 
	correctly on Wrath servers, and to support new stats and types of items that 
	appear in the expansion content, including new stats, new gems, encrypted 
	items, colorless sockets, and more.</li>
	<li>Pawn now sports a new tab, Compare, which lets you see two items 
	side-by-side to compare their stats in more detail.&nbsp; Check it out!<ul>
		<li>You can compare any two items in your inventory or a merchant&#39;s 
		inventory by dropping them in 
		the slots.</li>
		<li>If the left slot is empty and you drop an item in the right slot, 
		your currently equipped item will automatically be put in the left slot.</li>
		<li>In addition to dragging and dropping items, all of the following 
		shortcuts also work:<ul>
			<li>Clicking either of the &quot;currently equipped&quot; shortcut buttons 
			that appear in the lower-left corner once there is an item in the 
			right slot.</li>
			<li>Hovering over an item in your inventory, another player&#39;s 
			inventory, a vendor&#39;s inventory, an item link window, AtlasLoot, or 
			other locations, and pressing the &quot;[&quot; or 
			&quot;]&quot; key.&nbsp; (This key binding is customizable in the regular key 
			bindings interface.)</li>
			<li>You can also right-click item link windows and item icons in 
			loot roll windows to immediately compare the item with your 
			currently equipped item.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The first time you run Pawn after upgrading to 1.1, Pawn will 
	automatically bind keys to its commands if you aren&#39;t using those keys for 
	other things.&nbsp; By default, &quot;P&quot; will open and close the Pawn UI, and &quot;[&quot; 
	and &quot;]&quot; are used for item comparisons.&nbsp; If 
	you later unbind those keys or bind them to other actions, Pawn won&#39;t try to 
	rebind them.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn values didn&#39;t show up on item link windows if you 
	only had unenchanted numbers visible, not enchanted numbers.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where error text would appear in the chat window when 
	hovering over recipes in Ackis Recipe List and possibly other similar mods.</li>
	<li>German users rejoice!&nbsp; When entering stat values you can now use a 
	comma instead of a period as a decimal separator—for example, &quot;0,5&quot; now 
	works in addition to &quot;0.5&quot;.</li>
	<li>In this version of Pawn, I&#39;ve significantly reorganized a lot of the code that reads 
	and annotates item tooltips.&nbsp; This, coupled with other changes in Wrath 
	of the Lich King, is likely to cause some conflicts with other mods.&nbsp; 
	If you run into problems with Pawn, please remember to try to reproduce the 
	same problem with no other item-related mods installed.&nbsp; I still may be 
	able to fix the bug if it turns out that the bug is related to another mod, 
	but I need to know <i>which</i> mod to download and try.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug that would prevent Pawn from working properly if one or
	more of your scales didn't assign a value to the spell damage stat.</li>
	<li>Updated the value of the armor penetration and spell penetration stats 
	in the default Pawn scale to match current itemization.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales are not changed.</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer try to assign a default value to spell damage (WoW 2.4) if you use
	a scale that contains only spell power (WoW 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an entry in the Interface Options dialog to launch the Pawn UI, in 
	case you hide the Pawn button and forget how to get it back.</li>
	<li>You can now assign a value to the Wrath of the Lich King &quot;spell power&quot; 
	stat to your scales.&nbsp; It uses the same values by default as the &quot;spell 
	power&quot; stat in Pawn 0.7.4, and your existing scales will be assigned a value 
	for the stat automatically.&nbsp; Your scales will still have spell damage 
	and healing stats in them, but they won&#39;t be used for anything.</li>
	<li>In Wrath of the Lich King, the stats that currently appear as melee hit 
	rating, melee crit rating, and melee haste will also apply to spells, and 
	the spell hit, crit, and haste rating stats are not used.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be modified at this time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When Armory is installed, added support for showing unenchanted values 
	on the item comparison tooltips that appear when holding down the Alt key.</li>
	<li>Added support for the stat-only components of Surefooted, Cat&#39;s 
	Swiftness, and Boar&#39;s Speed.&nbsp; (The run speed and snare resistance 
	effects are ignored since there are no Pawn stats for those.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked a link for an item that had an icon and 
	then a link for a spell that did not have an icon, the item&#39;s icon would not 
	properly disappear.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with reading certain items with multiple stats on the same 
	line that was causing problems with the French translation in progress.</li>
	<li>Removed a bunch more asterisks from various items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s now possible to force Pawn to always calculate an item&#39;s value 
	based on the correct color of gems (Pawn 0.8 and older behavior) instead of 
	maximizing the item&#39;s value by potentially using the wrong colors and 
	ignoring the socket bonus (Pawn 0.9 and later behavior).&nbsp; To change the 
	option for one of your scales, choose that scale in the UI and then choose 
	one of the colored sockets from the stat list.</li>
	<li>Added support for socket bonuses (and possible future gems) that give 
	melee haste rating.</li>
	<li>Added shaman healing scales based on the popular Elitist Jerks thread to 
	the sample scales document that comes with Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Restored compatibility with Link Wrangler, which stopped working in Pawn 0.9.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing Pawn values on Link Wrangler&#39;s &quot;compare 
	equipped items&quot; tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing inventory icons next to Link Wrangler 
	tooltips.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a &quot;getting started&quot; tab to gently remind new users to read 
	the Readme file.</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of new WoW 2.4 functionality to show inventory icons 
	next to item link windows in a few situations where it couldn&#39;t before.</li>
	<li>Various other UI and text tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn is now smarter about the way that it values sockets and socket 
	bonuses, which in some cases will slightly change the values of certain 
	items, both with and without gems.<ul>
		<li>If you&#39;ve already filled all of the sockets on an item and you don&#39;t 
		qualify for the socket bonus, Pawn no longer counts the socket bonus 
		stats, since they&#39;re not actually there.</li>
		<li>If you can get a better value by socketing the wrong colors of gems 
		and ignoring the socket bonus, Pawn will now do that when calculating 
		item values.&nbsp; (When the &quot;Show debug info&quot; option is enabled, Pawn 
		will tell you which color gems it used.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn now remembers all of the stats from several of the last items 
	you&#39;ve viewed so it doesn&#39;t have to always recalculate them.&nbsp; This 
	should help your framerate when rapidly hovering over many items in 
	succession, especially when an equip compare mod is also installed.</li>
	<li>You now have to type the word &quot;delete&quot; to confirm that you really want 
	to delete a scale.</li>
	<li>You can now make a copy of an existing scale by clicking the new Copy 
	button.</li>
	<li>There is now an option to hide a specific scale from tooltips without 
	having to delete it (and, most likely, export it and paste it somewhere for 
	safekeeping).</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer look for stats on quest, spell, and ability links in 
	WoW 2.4.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bunch of UI bugs that occurred when deleting your last scale.</li>
	<li>Pawn no longer adds unnecessary asterisks to Black Temple instance-bound items, such as Naj&#39;entus Spine.</li>
	<li>Added support for Reckless Noble Topaz and other gems with spell haste 
	rating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now displays the current Pawn version number on the last 
	tab.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports addons that modify the Inspect window when it is first 
	shown instead of immediately upon login, such as Spyglass.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now hover over the Pawn button on the inventory window to get a 
	grand total of the enchanted values on all of your equipped items.</li>
	<li>There is now a disabled Pawn button on the inspect window that you can 
	hover over to get totals for all of another player&#39;s equipped items.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where all on/off options that defaulted to being on (show 
	enchanted values, show unenchanted values, and show tooltip icons) would 
	automatically turn back on after logging out and back in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes disabling enchanted values would cause 
	unenchanted values to also not be displayed.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the word &quot;Projectile&quot; on stacks of arrows would get an 
	asterisk, and their DPS would not count as ranged DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where negative values would not be exported in scale tags.&nbsp; 
	(Negative stat values are most common with weapon speed.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now has an Options tab that you can use to set all Pawn 
	options.</li>
	<li>Almost all of the Pawn slash commands are now unnecessary, and have been 
	removed.&nbsp; You can still use /pawn to open the Pawn UI, and /pawn debug 
	is still available as well.</li>
	<li>Tooltips have been added to pretty much everything in the Pawn UI.</li>
	<li>You can use the new calculation option &quot;Normalize values&quot; to divide all of your scale values by 
	the sum of all of the numbers in the scale.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to 
	generate the same sorts of numbers that Lootzor does.&nbsp; (See the 
	appropriate section in the readme file for more details.)</li>
	<li>You can now change the text color for your scales individually from the 
	Pawn UI.&nbsp; You could, for example, make your healing scale show up in 
	white and your DPS scale show up in red.</li>
	<li>You can now bind a key to the Pawn UI.&nbsp; Look under &quot;Pawn&quot; in the 
	standard key bindings list.</li>
	<li>Added support for the Fiery Weapon enchantment; Pawn counts it as 4 dps.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes tooltip icons would not appear for items 
	that had never been in your inventory.&nbsp; (This includes most links in 
	trade chat.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked on an item link for an item, and then a 
	tradeskill recipe (such as [Alchemy: Super Mana Potion]), the icon for the 
	previous item would stay since the recipe did not have one.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you had set custom colors for your scales, scales 
	would no longer always be sorted alphabetically by name on item tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now shows inventory icons next to item link and item comparison 
	tooltips, so when someone links an item, you can also see its inventory 
	icon.&nbsp; You can turn this feature off with /pawn icons off.<ul>
		<li>This feature works with the built-in WoW functionality, as well as a 
		variety of other tooltip mods: EquipCompare, EQCompare, and MultiTips.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When /pawn ids on is active, Pawn now displays the item IDs of all 
	applicable enchantments and gems in the tooltip as well.&nbsp; For example, 
	if looking at item 123 with no enchantment and gems 45 and 67 socketed, you 
	would see &quot;Item ID: 123:0:45:67&quot;.</li>
	<li>You can now have Pawn align item values (and IDs and levels, if those 
	options are on) along the right side of the tooltip with /pawn align numbers 
	right.&nbsp; Some people may find this easier to read; others may find it 
	more difficult.</li>
	<li>A new category of stats has been added, &quot;weapon types,&quot; which is 
	primarily useful for racial abilities and talents.<ul>
		<li>For example, orcs 
	get a passive 5 expertise bonus when using axes.&nbsp; So, you might give a 
		weapon a few bonus points just for being an axe.&nbsp; At level 70, 5 
		expertise costs 78.8 expertise rating, so you might value &quot;being an axe&quot; 
		as high as 78.8.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn plugins for FuBar and Titan Panel are now available as 
	separate downloads.&nbsp; You can get them at
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/">Curse</a>.</li>
	<li>The old &quot;spell power&quot; stat made sense before patch 2.3, but it was 
	particularly confusing to healers after that patch, so I&#39;ve removed it, and 
	replaced it with easier-to-understand &quot;spell damage&quot;.&nbsp; Now, 
	the healing stat only 
	includes healing, and the spell damage stat only includes spell damage.<ul>
		<li>Now, Light&#39;s Justice, which says that it increases healing by 382 
		and damage by 128, has 382 healing and 128 spell damage, exactly as 
		you&#39;d expect.</li>
		<li>Pawn will automatically upgrade your existing scales and any scale 
		tags that you import.&nbsp; Please double-check the value of the spell 
		damage stat after importing to make sure that it&#39;s what you intended, 
		as in this version Pawn does not read your mind.&nbsp; 
		The upgrade process will give correct results for typical cases (DPS 
		casters who don&#39;t care about healing; healers who valued spell power at 
		least as high as healing, as they should have), but may not give the 
		results you expect if you had a strange scale (healing but no spell 
		power).</li>
		<li>As always, the default Pawn scale has been adjusted to accommodate 
		these changes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn enchanted has been added to let you turn off 
	the enchanted item values, showing only the unenchanted, unsocketed values 
	for items.&nbsp; (You can also use /pawn enchanted off along with /pawn 
	unenchanted off to temporarily hide all Pawn values.)&nbsp; This option may 
	not be compatible with all of your favorite tooltip mods, but it should work 
	in all cases where you currently get unenchanted item values today, which is 
	most everywhere.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button has a new, unique look, instead of being a regular red 
	WoW button.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button now appears in a more reasonable spot when the character 
	inventory window has been skinned using a mod such as Skinner.</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn button has been added to let you move the Pawn 
	button on the inventory window, or hide it completely.&nbsp; (If you hide 
	the button, you&#39;ll need to type /pawn to open the Pawn UI, or use the 
	Pawn plugin for FuBar or Titan Panel.)</li>
	<li>Added a new option to the /pawn asterisks slash command, /pawn asterisks 
	no text.&nbsp; Using this option is the same as /pawn asterisks auto, except 
	the &quot;* Pawn gave no value to some stats&quot; warning text is not added to 
	tooltips of items with at least one (*) unrecognized stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a button to the inventory window to show and hide the Pawn 
	configuration UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports Armory and EquipCompare working together with the &quot;/eqc 
	alt&quot; option to show comparisons with your alt&#39;s gear instead of your current 
	character&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Added support for the unusual items with negative stats, such as Kreeg&#39;s 
	Mug, which gives -10 Intellect.</li>
	<li>Added support for Braided Eternium Chain and other non-weapon items with 
	weapon damage as an equip bonus.&nbsp; It shows up as minimum damage and 
	maximum damage, but not DPS—it&#39;s not a weapon, so there&#39;s no speed, and 
	therefore no DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that would frequently show up when using Pawn with 
	CowTip, causing an error message to appear in chat when hovering over an 
	item and then an empty inventory slot.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes an open item link window would not be 
	immediately updated upon making scale changes.</li>
	<li>Minor changes to fix some issues when running a German version of Pawn 
	on the German WoW client.</li>
	<li>Updated the samples scales document with newer versions of Emmerald&#39;s 
	feral combat models and ShadowPanther&#39;s AEP model, and added scales for 
	Malan&#39;s Elitist Jerks EP for shamans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The special weapon DPS stats now work.&nbsp; I had broken them in either 
	0.7 or 0.7.1.&nbsp; Existing scales will automatically be corrected; you 
	should not need to re-enter values for those stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If the item link window is open when you make changes to your Pawn 
	scales, it will now be updated immediately, so you can see how your changes 
	will affect the value of the item.</li>
	<li>Added spell hit rating and spell crit rating to the configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	(Oops!)</li>
	<li>Corrected a typo in the description of the melee and ranged crit rating 
	stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now has a configuration UI!&nbsp; To access it, simply type /pawn 
	in the chat box.&nbsp; (To see the help information that used to be 
	available when you typed /pawn, type /pawn help, or click the /pawn commands 
	button in the configuration UI.)&nbsp; You should no longer need to manually edit your SavedVariables files 
		to configure Pawn.</li>
		<li>The configuration UI is now the official way to make all changes to 
		your Pawn scales.&nbsp; Some of the slash commands that existed in 
		earlier versions of Pawn are gone, since they&#39;re no longer needed: /pawn 
		list, export, import, delete, rename.</li>
	<li>Eliminated that bug where sometimes unenchanted values would 
	disappear from items after a while.&nbsp; The problem seemed to be most 
	commonly linked to use of the world map, but also could occur after zoning 
	or showing the interface options window.</li>
	<li>Scales now appear in alphabetical order on item tooltips.</li>
	<li>Pawn now works with tekKompare and LootLink.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the value of resilience rating in the default Pawn 
	value scale was 0 instead of 1 as was intended.&nbsp; Scale tags that call resilience rating &quot;Resilience&quot; instead of &quot;ResilienceRating&quot; 
	will now be imported properly.</li>
	<li>The value of ArmorPenetration in the default Pawn value scale is now 
	0.1, based on the latest information on WoWWiki.</li>
	<li>Includes VgerCore 1.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for items in the guild bank vault.</li>
	<li>In <i>some</i> cases, you can use mods that create fake item tooltips 
	like AtlasLoot and ItemSync along with mods that mangle item tooltips like 
	Rating Buster, and Pawn will now still work.&nbsp; No guarantees that your 
	favorite combination of mods won&#39;t break Pawn, but this should help a lot of 
	people out.</li>
	<li>Finally fixed that bug where items with both durability and an Equip: or 
	Use: line that Pawn didn&#39;t understand would get asterisks on the wrong 
	lines.&nbsp; (For example, Stalker&#39;s Helm of Second Sight has this problem.)</li>
	<li>Added the /pawn space command, which adds a blank space before the item 
	values it adds to tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added a special &quot;stat&quot; called SpeedBaseline.&nbsp; SpeedBaseline isn&#39;t an 
	actual item property, but rather a number to be subtracted from weapon 
	speeds before they&#39;re multiplied by your scale values.&nbsp; For example, if 
	you&#39;re an enhancement shaman who wants to give weapons 1 point for every 0.1 
	second of speed slower than 2.9, use Speed = 10 (1 / 0.1) and SpeedBaseline 
	= 2.9.&nbsp; Weapons slower than 2.9 would instead lose points at the same rate.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of the FeralAp stat in the Pawn default scale from 
	0.5 to 0.4 so that feral items in 2.3 will have roughly the same values as 
	they did in 2.2 with the old Pawn default scale and so that the Pawn default 
	scale still roughly mimics item budget formulas.&nbsp; I do not necessarily 
	recommend that you change values in your own scales; your items have been 
	buffed, so it makes sense for their values to go up.</li>
	<li>Weapon skill rating stats have been removed from Pawn and the default 
	Pawn scale, as they&#39;ve been removed from the game in the patch.&nbsp; 
	Existing scales will not be automatically updated to use ExpertiseRating.</li>
	<li>Added Pawn values to gems in the socketing UI.</li>
	<li>Fixed the amount of healing and spell damage received from Teardrop 
	Tourmaline and possibly other gems that previously only gave healing.</li>
	<li>Added support for the new Chaotic Skyfire Diamond.</li>
	<li>Now displays a more readable error message when the embedded mod 
	VgerCore is missing or failed to load.</li>
	<li>Fixed several problems introduced in 2.3:<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 due to the new way that set item 
	tooltips look where Pawn was putting asterisks all over the name of the set, 
	the items in the set, and the set bonuses.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 where stats on meta gems weren&#39;t 
	always being counted due to requirements now being displayed on gems even 
	when socketed.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug that appeared in 2.3 only where certain gems and random item 
	properties would appear very strange, such as &quot;+45 Stamina|cfff1a1a1a&quot;, and 
	Pawn would not understand them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a script error that appeared the first time a recipe was clicked 
	since logging in or resetting your UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now includes VgerCore 1.0 embedded within the mod; you don&#39;t need a 
	separate VgerCore folder in your AddOns folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Supports the 2.2.x live realms and the 2.3 PTRs.&nbsp; 
	(Healing-to-spell-damage and expertise require 2.3, of course.)</li>
	<li>Support for the healing to spell damage conversion.&nbsp; Items that say 
	that they increase healing by 300 and spell damage by 100 will be reported 
	as Healing = 200, SpellPower = 100.&nbsp; Recall that SpellPower <i>includes</i> 
	healing, thus your scale&#39;s value for SpellPower should always be equal to or 
	greater than the value for Healing.</li>
	<li>A new value of .255 was picked for the value of Healing in the default 
	scale, down from .455.&nbsp; With this value, items that had 1/3 of their 
	Healing converted to SpellPower (default value .855) in 2.3 will have the exact 
	same values in 2.3 that they did with the old scale in 2.2 (ignoring rounding errors).&nbsp; Of 
	course, you can and should customize your Pawn scales to fit your needs; 
	generally, healers should <i>not </i>adjust their scales to deal with this 
	change.</li>
	<li>Support for the new ExpertiseRating stat, valued at 1 in the 
	default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale, same as the existing weapon skill 
	stats.&nbsp; Existing scales will not be adjusted to include this stat.&nbsp; 
	If you haven&#39;t customized your scales and want to reset them, use /pawn resetscales.<ul>
		<li>Weapon skill ratings are currently still supported so you can use 
		Pawn 0.6.1 on the live realms too.&nbsp; They&#39;ll be removed in a later 
		version.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Support for many more healing enchantments, inscriptions, spellthread, 
	and so forth.</li>
	<li>Craftable items for which you can learn recipes from trainers will now 
	get Pawn values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced in beta 1 where Pawn would display 
	an error message in the chat window whenever hovering over a ring with 
	Enchant Ring - Weapon Might.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to customize the colors that your scales will use when 
	printed.&nbsp; For example, you could have your DPS value show up in orange, 
	and your healing value show up in green.&nbsp; This is an advanced feature 
	that probably will never get its own UI or slash command.&nbsp; See the 
	section titled &quot;Changing the color of a scale&quot; for more information.</li>
	<li>Importing a scale tag that has the exact same name as a scale you 
	already have will update the old scale to match the values in the scale tag.&nbsp; 
	All of the values in the old scale will be deleted.&nbsp; (In previous 
	versions, Pawn would just fail and warn you that you can&#39;t overwrite an 
	existing scale.&nbsp; There is no longer a warning.)</li>
	<li>Weapon stats have been overhauled!&nbsp; Old scales will work, but now 
	advanced users have a variety of new options for assigning values to 
	weapons.</li>
	<li>New stats: MeleeMinDamage, MeleeMaxDamage, MeleeSpeed, MeleeDps, 
	MainHandMinDamage, MainHandMaxDamage, MainHandSpeed, MainHandDps, 
	OffHandMinDamage, OffHandMaxDamage, OffHandSpeed, OffHandDps, 
	OneHandMinDamage, OneHandMaxDamage, OneHandSpeed, OneHandDps, 
	TwoHandMinDamage, TwoHandMaxDamage, TwoHandSpeed, TwoHandDps, 
	RangedMinDamage, RangedMaxDamage, RangedSpeed, RangedDps.&nbsp; Generally, 
	you&#39;ll only use a few of these, and not give values to all of them.</li>
	<li>New stats: MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t care about 
	which slot or weapon type it is, just use MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed, 
	and/or Dps.&nbsp; Dps is now calculated to full precision (say, 41.333 
	instead of 41.3) instead of rounded to one decimal place.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon damage enchantments (Striking and Impact).</li>
	<li>Added support for ranged weapon scopes.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where certain items with suffixes would show unusually low unenchanted
	values (their stats would be read as 0).  For example, Chimaerascale Legguards of the Bandit
	exhibited this problem.</li>
	<li>Added support for Black Morass instance-bound items (beacons).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for haste rating and spell haste rating, which were added as passive
	item bonuses on Black Temple equipment.  (Iron Counterweight is also supported.)  These two
	stats (HasteRating, SpellHasteRating) are valued at 1 each on the default Pawn scale; existing
	Pawn scales won't be affected.  Use /pawn resetscales to delete all of your scales and replace them
	with the default one.</li>
	<li>Added support for armor penetration ("Your attacks ignore X of your opponent's armor").
	This stat (ArmorPenetration) is not valued in the default Pawn scale.</li>
	<li>Added support for Karazhan, Stratholme, and Tempest Keep instance-bound items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the new gold profession recipe links in WoW 2.1.&nbsp; 
	(Pawn won&#39;t try to read them or put asterisks all over them.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added working support for the Savagery weapon enchantment, and untested support
	for Potency, Soulfrost, and Sunfire.</li>
	<li>Added support for EquipCompare 2.10.&nbsp; (This may break compatibility 
	with older versions of EquipCompare; please use the latest version.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for WoW patch 2.1.</li>
	<li>Added support for Blizzard&#39;s new Currently Equipped functionality 
	(shift-hover an item).</li>
	<li>LinkWrangler support.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where stats in certain situations (gems with multiple stats 
	on one gem, socket bonuses, etc.) wouldn&#39;t get shown in the /pawn debug on 
	output.&nbsp; This did not affect calculation; it was just a debug display error.</li>
	<li>Expanded the amount of information Pawn returns in the debug output.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Vitality.</li>
	<li>Slightly updated a few of the default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale&#39;s numbers.&nbsp; 
	This will not affect existing scales, even if you haven&#39;t changed any of the 
	defaults.&nbsp; If you want to get the new scale, you can wipe out your 
	existing scale(s) with /pawn resetscales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Requires VgerCore 0.4.  (This is included with the mod.  Pawn will warn you if you
	are using an older version of VgerCore.)</li>
	<li>Pawn can now show unenchanted values for items in addition to the 
	regular enchanted values, and this is enabled by default.&nbsp; You can turn 
	it off with /pawn unenchanted off.&nbsp; This feature only works for real 
	tooltips, and not fake tooltips from an item database mod.</li>
	<li>Added an option to control the number of digits of precision Pawn uses 
	to display item values in tooltips.&nbsp; By default this is 1 (&quot;3.1&quot;), but 
	you can set it to any number between 0 (&quot;3&quot;) and 4 (&quot;3.1416&quot;) with /pawn 
	digits #.</li>
	<li>Corrected the value of frost resistance in the default Pawn scale to 1 
	(was 4).</li>
	<li>Pawn scale tags now have spaces inside of the parentheses by default.&nbsp; 
	This is to prevent certain scale tags from turning into emoticons when 
	posted to certain forums.&nbsp; (For example, if your scale tag ended in &quot;RedSocket=8)&quot;, 
	the 8) would turn into an emoticon on certain forums.)&nbsp; Old and current 
	versions of Pawn will accept the scale with or without the extra spaces. </li>
	<li>Lots of work was done to prepare for Pawn translations into other languages.&nbsp; 
	I may have made a mistake in this conversion and introduced cases where (*) 
	shows up where they didn&#39;t before; hopefully not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for gun, bow, and crossbow skill ratings.</li>
	<li>Added support for MultiTips.</li>
	<li>Added support for items that list stats as &quot;Stat +X&quot; instead of &quot;+X 
	Stat&quot;, namely the epic gems.&nbsp; Gems that only provided primary stats, 
	such as Seer&#39;s Chrysoprase, already worked, but others such as Rune Covered 
	Chrysoprase didn&#39;t work until this change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added scale tags!&nbsp; Scale tags are chunks of text that you can use 
	to share Pawn scales with friends, guildmates, and others on forums, similar 
	to how you can share talent specs today by passing around a link to the WoW 
	talent calculator.&nbsp; You can copy a scale tag and then post it on your 
	guild forums, and then another player can copy that tag and paste it into 
	their game to automatically add your scale to their copy of Pawn, without 
	logging out of the game or changing files in Notepad.&nbsp; To export a 
	scale tag so you can share it with others, use the /pawn export command.&nbsp; 
	To import someone else&#39;s scale tag and add it to your own scales, use the 
	/pawn import command.</li>
	<li>Added new slash commands: /pawn list, export, import, delete, and 
	rename.&nbsp; See &quot;Slash commands&quot; in Readme.htm for more details.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon skill ratings (including unarmed and feral 
	combat).&nbsp; (They have been added to the default Pawn scale, but if you 
	care about weapon skill ratings you must add them to your custom scales 
	manually.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the /pawn resetscales command so that it would delete all of your 
	scales before recreating the default one named Pawn value, as was intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hovering over an enchanted Item X immediately after hovering over an 
	unenchanted Item X will now recalculate the values for the second item 
	instead of just displaying the ones for the first item.&nbsp; This should 
	work for all pairs of items that differ only by enchantments and gems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To read statistics, Pawn now makes a copy of the tooltip and reads from 
	that whenever possible, which allows it to read tooltips that have been 
	mangled by other mods.&nbsp; Examples of mods that do this are Mendeleev and 
	Rating Buster.&nbsp; (Certain mods that use custom tooltips, such as 
	ItemSync, don&#39;t support this; Pawn may still conflict with mods that modify 
	those custom tooltips.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ItemSync support, including using ItemSync with AtlasLoot.&nbsp; Pawn 
	will calculate and display values for ItemSync&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>EQCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EQCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>Item level display should work just about everywhere now, instead of 
	just in certain places.&nbsp; (In previous versions, it worked for inventory 
	items, but not chat item links.&nbsp; Now it works on both.)</li>
	<li>A new option has been added to display the item ID for items you come 
	across, /pawn ids on.</li>
	<li>The default is now to hide the asterisks (*) from items that don&#39;t have 
	any values for any of your scales.&nbsp; So, for example, Hearthstone and 
	potions won&#39;t display the asterisk.&nbsp; You can change this behavior using 
	/pawn asterisks [ on | auto | off ].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem in 0.2 where Pawn wouldn&#39;t work if you&#39;d never used 
	version 0.1 before.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>EquipCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EquipCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>AtlasLoot support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	instance drops when Atlas and AtlasLoot are installed.</li>
	<li>Outfitter support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the lines 
	that Outfitter adds to tooltips of items used in one or more gear sets.</li>
	<li>MonkeyQuest support.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t actually observed it happening in 
	the past, but this change should prevent MonkeyQuest&#39;s item tooltip 
	annotations from affecting Pawn.</li>
	<li>MobInfo-2 support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the drop rate 
	information that MobInfo-2 adds to items.&nbsp; (This problem manifested 
	itself both as unnecessary asterisks added to tooltips, and also as an 
	&quot;attempted to concatenate a nil value&quot; error.)</li>
	<li>Added APIs to create and change Pawn scales while you&#39;re still logged 
	in.&nbsp; These will eventually be used to build a configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	If you <i>really</i> want to, you can use them from the chat box to change 
	Pawn scales while logged into the game.</li>
	<li>Included a new file "Sample scales.htm" containing (you guessed it) some
	sample scales that you can use to get started creating your own.  I'll add to this
	over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The first released beta version of Pawn.&nbsp; The code is stable and 
	the remaining bugs are mostly just to-do items.&nbsp; I&#39;ll get around to 
	them eventually.</li>
	<li>Not heavily optimized for performance.</li>
	<li>No configuration UI.&nbsp; (Hope you like Notepad!)</li>
</ul>
